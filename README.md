To use Rasper you need to make two things: <br>
<br>
A bot account: https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/getting_started/bot_application.html <br>
<br>
A project: https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/getting_started/basic_bot.html <br>
<br>
Lavalink: https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink <br>
<br> 
<br> 
The setup of Rasper is very simplified. Its so easy that you only need to make the bot account with the tutorial! After the bot is created you need to make a project with visual studio(preferred atm with 2019). Follow the second step and download with NuGet the pre release version of DsharpPlus 4.0.0. After you done you this you need to pasted the code in your project with the same classes. After you have done this step you only have to setuped the LavaLink. The LavaLink is used for multiple things and because if this it is indispensable. Follow the LavaLink and install everything. Now you need to run the JAR file of LavaLink and also run you visual studio project. If your bots is in a discord server you only have to use the commands and enjoy the music!
<br>
<br>
<br>
  Commands bot:
  !lavalink play (link)
  !lavalink join
  !lavalink stop
  !lavalink volume
  !lavalink nowplaying
  !advise
  !github
<br>
  <b> All the commands are still worked on atm </b>
